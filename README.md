- 👋 Hi, I’m @tsjechov
- 👀 I’m interested in compilers, kernels, drivers. But those are just my wet dreams, I'm also interested in various other stuff like PLC or anything else crossing my path.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something with a modern c++ codebase, can be anything that seems interesting but I'm very limited in time
- 📫 You can PM me I guess
